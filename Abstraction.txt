Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation 
details and showing only the essential features of an object.
 It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort. 
 By using abstraction, a programmer can focus on what an object
  does instead of how it does it.

Example: Consider a car. When you drive a car, 
you interact with its steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift.
 You don't need to understand the complex mechanics of the engine,
  transmission, or braking system.
 The car's interface (steering wheel, pedals, etc.) 
 abstracts the complex details of its internal workings.

In programming, abstraction can be achieved using abstract 
classes and interfaces.
