private public and protrectes
Let's break down the three access specifiers in C++: private, public, and protected.

Private
Access: Members declared as private are accessible only within the same class. They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

Usage: Private members are used to encapsulate data and hide implementation details from the outside world.

Example:

cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int privateVar;
public:
    void setPrivateVar(int value) {
        privateVar = value;
    }
};
Public
Access: Members declared as public are accessible from anywhere in the program. They can be accessed directly from outside the class.

Usage: Public members are used to define the interface of the class, allowing interaction with the class's objects.

Example:

cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int publicVar;
};
Protected
Access: Members declared as protected are accessible within the same class and its derived classes. They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

Usage: Protected members are used to allow derived classes to access and modify the base class's data while still restricting access from outside the class hierarchy.

Example:

cpp
class BaseClass {
protected:
    int protectedVar;
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
public:
    void setProtectedVar(int value) {
        protectedVar = value;
    }
};
Summary
Private: Accessible only within the class.

Public: Accessible from anywhere.

Protected: Accessible within the class and its derived classes.

These access specifiers help in implementing encapsulation and controlling the visibility of class members, ensuring that the internal state of an object is protected from unintended interference.
