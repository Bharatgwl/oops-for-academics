1. public Access Specifier:
->Members declared as public can be accessed from anywhere in the program (inside and outside the class).
->It is typically used when you want to allow access to certain data or methods without restriction
2. private Access Specifier:
->Members declared as private can only be accessed within the class itself.
->They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. 
->To access them, you need to provide public getter/setter methods or other public interfaces.
->private ensures encapsulation, meaning the internal data is hidden from external access and manipulation.
